         <h2>BEST PLACE TO BUY CRYPTO</h2>
         <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/593d4980301fd08d1c04b934" title="Coinbase Cryptocurrency Exchange" target="_blank"><img class="banner" src="/images/coinbase-promo.jpg"></a>
         <p>When it comes to the most convenient and reliable place to buy cryptocurrencies, there's no better service then what <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/593d4980301fd08d1c04b934" title="Coinbase Cryptocurrency Exchange" target="_blank"><strong>Coinbase</strong></a> has to offer. They accept both credit cards and wire transfers. There's also an option to <strong>get Bitcoin, Ethereum or Liecoin instantly</strong>, even without credit card.</p>
         <p>As you'll see (or maybe you already have seen), most cryptocurrency exchanges allow only for cryptocurrency trading. Exchanges like Coinbase that have to comply with more strict regulations, allow for exchanging fiat (regular currencies like USD, EURO etc.) into cryptocurrencies. As I mentioned, they don't have too much choice available, but they are the best on-ramp exchange that gets you into the world of crypto. From there, when you get your hands on Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin, you can go to other markets like <strong>Bittrex</strong> or <strong>Poloniex</strong> and get other cryptocurrencies and start trading.</p>
         <h3>Get 10$ worth of free Bitcoin</h3>
         <p>By registering on <strong>Coinbase</strong> using this <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/593d4980301fd08d1c04b934" title="Coinbase Cryptocurrency Exchange" target="_blank"><b>link</b></a> and buying or selling $100.00 USD worth of cryptocurrency, both of us will <strong>get 10$ worth of Bitcoin for free</strong>. I know that it may not sound like much, but if you hold on to it for a few years I'm sure you may be surprised. In positive way, of course!

         <h3>How not to pay additional fees at Coinbase</h3>
         <p>
            <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/593d4980301fd08d1c04b934" title="Coinbase Cryptocurrency Exchange" target="_blank"><strong>Coinbase</strong></a>, except for it's regular exchange, also runs a trading exchange under name <a href="https://www.gdax.com/" title="GDAX Cryptocurrency Trading Exchange" target="_blank"><strong>GDAX</strong></a>. It's connected with Coinbase, so you can login with your Coinbase account and transfer money instantly between GDAX and Coinbase. By using GDAX you're able to trade with other people, which gets rid of all the fees that Coinbase normally charges. So if you're not in a rush and want to get most crypto for your buck, wire transfer money to Coinbase, then move it GDAX and buy crypto from there.
